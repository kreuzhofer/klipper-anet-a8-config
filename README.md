# klipper-anet-a8-config

This repository contains Daniel's customized Anet A8 configuration file printer.cfg and the addtional scripts used in the custom-scripts.cfg
Upload both files into your printer's configuration folder to overwrite the existing files if you have a printer with a bed leveling probe conntected to the original z-level input.

If you have a BLTouch mod on your Anet A8 you may still use this as a base configuration but you will need to make changes for the BLTouch to work as Z-Level probe.
